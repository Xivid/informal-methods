# Task 4

## Using a heap-like structure

Using a heap-like structure `hp3` to represent unmarked nodes based on `m` values allows getting the m-least unmarked node without linear searching.
Previously in each iteration we need O(1) time to remove a node from the unmarked list, and O(N) time to find the m-least one. As the loop terminates in at most N iterations, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N^2).
Now with a min-heap, in each iteration the removal takes O(log(N)) and getting the minimum takes O(1). In addition, the heap invariant needs to be maintained on update of `m`, each taking O(log(N)) time, but there can be at most E updates, where E is the number of arcs in the graph. So in total the complexity is O(max(NlogN, ElogN)).
Therefore, it makes the algorithm much more efficient when `E << N^2` (i.e. the graph is sparse).

## Other variables to be added

Other than the heap `hp3`, which is a list of (m value, node id) pairs, we also need to keep track of the index of each node's corresponding pair in `hp3`, so a list `idx3` needs to be added. The coupling invariants are:

- "(m[i], i) in hp3" iff "un1[i] == 1"; and len(hp3) == nun1
- idx3[i] is the index of pair (m[i], i) in hp3 if un1[i] == 1, otherwise idx3[i] == N

In this way the variables `un1` and `nun1` can be removed.

## Statements involving `m` that are affected

Some statements not involving `m` are also affected, but not listed here because they are not asked. Instead, please see the refinements in the code below directly.

1. After initialisation of m (`m= [INFTY]*N; m[0]= 0`)

The heap and indices needs to be initialized, with the pairs (m[i], i) for all unmarked nodes:

```python
hp3 = [(m[i], i) for i in range(N)]  # "(m[i], i) in hp3" iff "un1[i] == 1"; and len(hp3) == nun1
idx3 = list(range(N))  # idx3[i] is the index of pair (m[i], i) in hp3 if un1[i] == 1, otherwise idx3[i] == N
```

Because all `m[i]`s are âˆž except that `m[0] == 0`, after this initialization `hp3` is already in heap structure, so no need to explicitly heapify it.

2. After updating m (`m[nTo]= newD`)

The heap also needs to be updated with the new m value:

```python
heapupdate(hp3, idx3, (newD, nTo))
```

This decreases `hp3[idx3[nTo]]` to `newD`, then re-establish the heap invariant by swapping the updated element upwards (until its m-value >= its parent's), and updating `idx3` meanwhile.

3. Getting the m-least unmarked node: statements `for n in range(N): if un1[n]: if m[n]<=minD: tn= n; minD= m[n]`

Now we can replace these statements by reading the m-least unmarked node directly from the heap. Note that the heap may contain marked nodes, so we need to keep popping until we get an unmarked one.

## Code

```python
import sys; INFTY= 1000
from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop
print "How many nodes? ",
N= int(sys.stdin.readline()) # N= number of nodes.
print "Nodes are 0..%d, with initial node %d." % (N-1, 0)

# Three white-space separated integers representing (from,dist,to) per line.
print "Now enter the edges:"
G2 = [[] for i in range(N)]
for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
    nFrom, dist, nTo = map(int, line.split())
    G2[nFrom].append((dist, nTo))
un1 = [1]*N; nun1 = N   # un1[i] == 1 for all nodes: all nodes are unmarked
m= [INFTY]*N; m[0]= 0   # m:=  initially INFTY except for initial node
#>>
hp3 = [(m[i], i) for i in range(N)]  # [(m[0], 0)]
heapify(hp3)
#<<
tn= 0                   # tn:= initial node

# Initialisation has established the invariants:
#   I1--- For all marked nodes, m has the least distance from 0. // A.
#   I2--- For all unmarked nodes, m has least all-marked distance from 0. // B.
#   I3--- Node tn is unmarked, and is m-least among the unmarked nodes. // C.

while 1:
    un1[tn] = 0; nun1 -= 1
    if nun1 == 0: break

    # Re-establish I2. // G.
    for (dist, nTo) in G2[tn]:
        if un1[nTo]:
            newD= m[tn]+dist
            if newD<m[nTo]:
                m[nTo]= newD
#>>
                heappush(hp3, (newD, nTo))
#<<

    # Re-establish I3. // H.
    minD= INFTY
#>> for n in range(N):
#>>   if un1[n]:
#>>     if m[n]<=minD: tn= n; minD= m[n]
    while hp3:
        dist, n = heappop(hp3)
        if un1[n]:
            minD, tn = dist, n
            break
#<<

    if minD==INFTY: break # All remaining nodes unreachable. // I.
###
#   I1,I2 and m is INFTY for all nodes in un1. // J,K,L,M.

print "Least distances from Node 0 are:"
for n in range(N):
    if m[n]!=INFTY: print "Distance to Node %d is %d." % (n,m[n])
    else:           print "Node %d is unreachable." % n
```
