# Task 4

## Using a heap-like structure

Using a heap-like structure `hp3` to represent unmarked nodes based on `m` values is good, because in each iteration we need to remove a node from the unmarked list, and find the m-least unmarked node from the remaining. Right now the removal takes a time complexity of O(1), but searching takes O(N), so in total they takes O(N). But with a min-heap, removal takes O(log(n)) and searching takes O(1), in total O(log(n)). The algorithm will be much more efficient with this refinement.

## Other variables to be added

No other variables need to be added other than `hp3`, which is a list of (m value, node id) pairs, maintained as a min-heap using python built-in `heapq` functions.

## Statements affected

1. On initialisation of m: `m= [INFTY]*N; m[0]= 0`

The heap needs to be initialized, with the pairs (m[i], i) for all unmarked nodes: `hp3 = [(m[i], i) for i in range(N)]; heapify(hp3)`

2. On updating of m: `m[nTo]= newD`

The heap also needs to be updated with the new m value: `heappush(hp3, (newD, nTo))`. It does not matter if in the heap there already exists a pair for the same node, because its priority-in-heap cannot be higher than newD. By the time the old pair is poped, `nTo` will have been marked (immediately after the higher priority pair for the same node was poped), so this pair will be ignored. 

3. Getting the m-least unmarked node: statements `for n in range(N): if un1[n]: if m[n]<=minD: tn= n; minD= m[n]`

Now we can replace these statements by reading the m-least unmarked node directly from the heap. Note that the heap may contain marked nodes, so we need to keep popping until we get an unmarked one.

## Code

```python
import sys; INFTY= 1000
from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop
print "How many nodes? ",
N= int(sys.stdin.readline()) # N= number of nodes.
print "Nodes are 0..%d, with initial node %d." % (N-1, 0)

# Three white-space separated integers representing (from,dist,to) per line.
print "Now enter the edges:"
G2 = [[] for i in range(N)]
for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
    nFrom, dist, nTo = map(int, line.split())
    G2[nFrom].append((dist, nTo))
un1 = [1]*N; nun1 = N   # un1[i] == 1 for all nodes: all nodes are unmarked
m= [INFTY]*N; m[0]= 0   # m:=  initially INFTY except for initial node
#>>
hp3 = [(m[i], i) for i in range(N)]  # [(m[0], 0)]
heapify(hp3)
#<<
tn= 0                   # tn:= initial node

# Initialisation has established the invariants:
#   I1--- For all marked nodes, m has the least distance from 0. // A.
#   I2--- For all unmarked nodes, m has least all-marked distance from 0. // B.
#   I3--- Node tn is unmarked, and is m-least among the unmarked nodes. // C.

while 1:
    un1[tn] = 0; nun1 -= 1
    if nun1 == 0: break

    # Re-establish I2. // G.
    for (dist, nTo) in G2[tn]:
        if un1[nTo]:
            newD= m[tn]+dist
            if newD<m[nTo]:
                m[nTo]= newD
#>>
                heappush(hp3, (newD, nTo))
#<<

    # Re-establish I3. // H.
    minD= INFTY
#>> for n in range(N):
#>>   if un1[n]:
#>>     if m[n]<=minD: tn= n; minD= m[n]
    while hp3:
        dist, n = heappop(hp3)
        if un1[n]:
            minD, tn = dist, n
            break
#<<

    if minD==INFTY: break # All remaining nodes unreachable. // I.
###
#   I1,I2 and m is INFTY for all nodes in un1. // J,K,L,M.

print "Least distances from Node 0 are:"
for n in range(N):
    if m[n]!=INFTY: print "Distance to Node %d is %d." % (n,m[n])
    else:           print "Node %d is unreachable." % n
```
