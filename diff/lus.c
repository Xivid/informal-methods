/** Find the length of a longest upsequence of a sequence of integers 
 *
 *  Input: one line of integers, separated by space
 *  Output: the length of the longest upsequence(s) of the input sequence
 *
 *  Example:
 *  [Input]
 *  6 5 1 4 3 2 4 3 2 1
 *  [Output]
 *  3
 *  (Explanation: the longest upsequences are [1, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 4], of which
 *   the length is 3.)
